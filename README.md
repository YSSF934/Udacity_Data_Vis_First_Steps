# Udacity_Data_Vis_First_Steps
In this repository I was going through the diferent Chapters of Data Visualization on Udacity (Data Analyst Nano Degree).

We first started with simple bar charts. After this going to the histrograms. Those two were parts of Univariate Exploration of Data, as well as thirt file - Scales and Transformation Practice, where I was using log log funktions to scale the data with very skewed distribution.

In the next part of Bivariate Exploration of Data I was working with these kinds of plots:

Scatterplot
Violin and Box Plot
Categorical Plot (histograms with more than one variable)
In Additional Plot Practice I was using a FaceGrid Function to plot many histograms for every type of car from the database.

In the Multivariate Exploration of Data (Encoding_Practice) I was working with different color palettes fpr different variables to make the graphics more clear and easy to understand. In Addapted Plot Practice I continued to work with Multivariate Exploration but with the help of heatmaps and box plots.

In the last to files I work with different type of vizualisation of data plus I learned how to do the Explonatory Vizualisation within Jupyter Notebook.
